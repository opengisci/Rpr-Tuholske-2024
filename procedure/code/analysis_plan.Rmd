# Abstract

This study is a *reproduction* of: Tuholske, C., Lynch, V.D., Spriggs, R.
et al.
Hazardous heat exposure among incarcerated people in the United States.
*Nat Sustain 7*, 394â€“398 (2024).
<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-024-01293-y> [Git Repository](https://github.com/sparklabnyc/temperature_prisons_united_states_2024)

By reproducing the exploratory data analysis done in Tuholske et al. (2024), we seek to...

*1.* Identify the temporal resolution at which authors use population data to calculate population weighted hazardous heat days

*2.* Understand the population weighting mechanism in state-level hazardous heat calculations.

*3.* Evaluate the effectiveness of the author's methods compared to similar research.

# Study design

This study is a **reproduction study**, and the original study is more **exploratory** in design.
The primary objective for exploration through research and analysis investigated in the original study was exposure to hazardous heat in carceral facilities in the continental U.S.
The authors wanted to examine how exposure to hazardous heat changed over time from 1982-2020, as well as how exposure within carceral facilities compared to exposure in the rest of the state.
In general, determining the spatial distribution of carceral facilities with higher levels of hazardous heat exposure was also an objective of the original paper

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

### Original study computational environment

The original study data transformations and analysis were completed primarily in R using Rmd documents, as well as in Python.
The versions of R and Python used are not disclosed, but would have been R 4.3.3 or earlier, and Python 3.12 or earlier.

In the original study, R packages are called in across different scripts.
However, it seems that the important ones for this study are:

```{r eval=FALSE}
original_study_packages <- c(
  "dplyr", 
  "data.table", 
  "maptools",
  "mapproj",
  "rgeos",
  "rgdal",
  "RColorBrewer",
  "ggplot2",
  "raster", # planned deviation: we will be using `stars` in our reproduction
  "sp", # planned deviation: we will be using `sf` in our reproduction
  "plyr",
  "graticule",
  "zoo",
  "purrr",
  "cowplot",
  "janitor"
  )
```

### Prepare reproduction computational environment

For the reproduction study, we will be using R version 4.4.2, and the `groundhog` package to maintain package consistency.
All packages used will be up to date as of 2025-02-01.

We plan on using the packages `tidyverse`, `here`, `markdown`, `htmltools`, `dplyr`, `sf`, and `stars`.
As we encounter the need for other packages in our implimentation of the code, we will make note of them as unplanned deviations.

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "markdown", "htmltools", "dplyr", "sf", "stars")

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2025-02-01"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day,
                  tolerate.R.version='4.4.2')
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

# record the R processing environment
# alternatively, use devtools::session_info() for better results
writeLines(
  capture.output(sessionInfo()),
  here("procedure", "environment", paste0("r-environment-", Sys.Date(), ".txt"))
)

# save package citations
knitr::write_bib(c(packages, "base"), file = here("software.bib"))

# set up default knitr parameters
# https://yihui.org/knitr/options/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, # Show outputs, but not code. Change to TRUE to show code as well
  fig.retina = 4,
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.path = paste0(here("results", "figures"), "/")
)
```

## Data and variables

We are going to use data from the original study's git repository (linked on top level readme).
This includes:

\- Population data for the study period

\- Prison boundary polygons with facility information

\- State polygons

\- WBGT data, at prison point and state levels

### Population Data

```{r}
includeMarkdown(
  here("data", "metadata", "metadata_population.md")
)
```

### Prison Boundaries

```{r}
includeMarkdown(
  here("data", "metadata", "metadata_Prison_Boundaries.md")
)
```

### State Boundaries

```{r}
includeMarkdown(
  here("data", "metadata", "metadata_statesshp.md")
)
```

### WBGT Data

#### WBGT Data - Prison Level

```{r}
includeMarkdown(
  here("data", "metadata", "metadata_wbgt_prison.md")
)
```

#### WBGT Data - State Level

```{r}
includeMarkdown(
  here("data", "metadata", "metadata_wbgt_state.md")
)
```

## Prior observations

At the time of this pre-analysis plan, we have the derived data to work off of, and we have examined some of the csv tables.
We have neither visualized nor analyzed prison data or WBGTmax temperature data before.

## Bias and threats to validity

There are no statistical tests in this study, so issues such as spatial heterogeneity/anistropy/autocorrelation do not matter.
Scale could be a threat to validity, because county populations are aggregated to calculate the number of population-weighted heat days in each state.
There is also a scale issue measuring micro-climate conditions at prison boundaries compared to 4 km temperature data.
Further, there is no specification of how heat days are calculated within each county given that counties do no map neatly to 4 km by 4km grids used to calculate hazardous heat days.
The ways in which the county boundaries are drawn also supports the argument that there is a Modifiable Area Unit Problem.

Both the scale and boundary issues also have a temporal component that may create threats to validity.

## Data transformations

### Planned deviation:

We will not attempt to produce the original study's WBGTmax grid because the methods are unclear, and therefore we will skip to joining the author-provided WBGTmax by day grid data to the prison points.

(When implementing plan) Explain what we believe the authors did to produce the WBGTmax grid and preliminary steps

### Transform data to create Figures 1a, 1b

(More descriptive segment of original study's workflow)

#### Step 1: Join author-provided WBGTmax by day grid data to author-provided carceral facility point data

Use `st_join()` or `st_extract()`

*Result:* Rds table of WBGTmax by day by prison

#### Step 2: Filter result by days when WBGTmax exceeded 28 degrees C

#### Step 3: Group by carceral facility type and year

Count to produce summary of days exceeded per year by facility

*Result:* Rds table with variables\
- prison facility

\- facility type

\- prison population

\- n days exceeding 28 degrees

\- year

## Analysis

### Analyze data to create Figures 2a, 2b and 2c

Figure 2b, 2c - results are based on linear regression models

#### Step 4: Begin with result from Step 3

#### Step 5: Spatial join county population by year data

*Result:* Rds table with variables\
- prison facility

\- facility type

\- prison population

\- county

\- population

\- n days exceeding 28 degrees

\- year

#### Step 6: Population-weighted aggregation

Aggregate data into states

Weighted sum of days exceeded across all counties of the state

Sum of days exceeded multiplied by (Ratio of county population / state population)

## Planned deviations for reproduction:

### Deviation 1: Investigating temperature threshold

Repeat workflow for reproducing figures 1 and 2, instead filtering for days when WBGTmax exceeded 29.4 degrees C (85 degrees F standard informed by other literature)

### Deviation 2: Investigating sources of uncertainty/error/bias

#### How many open facilities had a population of -999? (Potential source of uncertainty)

#### Step 7: Select facilities with population of -999 from author-provided carceral facilities data.

Report number of facilities compared to authors' number.

# Results: Present figures (reproduced from original study and planned deviations).

## Create Fig. 1a and b using results from step 3

## Create Fig. 2a, b and c using results from step 6

## Map result from step 7 to examine data quality issue

# Discussion

What are the implications of us being able to recreate or not recreate the figures?
Why does it matter for the original study to be reproducible?
Mention significance of groundhog usage for sustainable reproduction.
Discuss research suggesting maximum daily temperature doesn't matter as much for heat stress, and how long stretches of night time lows may be more serious.

# Integrity Statement

This is the first version of our pre-analysis plan.
Any deviations in our workflow will be documented as unplanned deviations.
