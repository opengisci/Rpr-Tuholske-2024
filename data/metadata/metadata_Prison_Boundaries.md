- `Distribution`: Data available in original study's [git repository](https://github.com/sparklabnyc/temperature_prisons_united_states_2024)
- `Constraints`: Public Domain
- `Data Quality`: Unclear lineage documentation, man missing facility population values
- `Variables`: For each variable, enter the following information. If you have two or more variables per data source, you may want to present this information in table form (shown below)
  - `Label`: variable name as used in the data or code
  - `Alias`: intuitive natural language name
  - `Definition`: Short description or definition of the variable. Include measurement units in description.
  - `Type`: data type, e.g. character string, integer, real
  - `Accuracy`: e.g. uncertainty of measurements
  - `Domain`: Expected range of Maximum and Minimum of numerical data, or codes or categories of nominal data, or reference to a standard codebook
  - `Missing Data Value(s)`: Values used to represent missing data and frequency of missing data observations
  - `Missing Data Frequency`: Frequency of missing data observations: not yet known for data to be collected
