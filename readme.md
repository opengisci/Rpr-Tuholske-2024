## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
